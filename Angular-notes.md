## Angular

### What is Angular ?

Angular is a TypeScript-based, open-source framework for building single-page web applications (SPAs). It's a popular choice for developers due to its robust features, extensive documentation, and large community.

### what is open-source ?

Open-source development allows anyone to view the source code, contribute to its development, and report bugs. This transparency fosters a strong community around Angular, where developers can learn from each other, share knowledge, and collaborate on improvements.

    for eg : 
    if i am developing some application for my users and making it public such that anyone can see the code and can use it, if they want can give me feedbacks and report bugs so that by this means developers can engage other developers and can get good insight about the application.

- Open-source development allows for a more rapid pace of innovation. Bug fixes, improvements, and new features can be implemented and released quickly,

### What is a framework ?

Suppose we want to build a house, basic materials that is needed to build a house are `bricks` , `cement`, `steel` , `labour`.

now building a house can be done in 2 ways:

- if a person himself takes responsibilty of everything
- if he delegated the work to someone else (in this case a professional developer) who will look after all the things.


same is with like framework -> a framework is a complete package, it is a collection of tools and everything needed to build a complete thing.

What angular provides : 

`angular routing`, `compiler` ,`security`, `angular-forms`, `karma and jasmine frameworks for testing`.


### is Angular not a js framework ?

No! Though we know that Only browsers can understand javascript only.
but angular is a typescript based.

Angular was first launched in 2010, by that time it was built using javascript only, but due t few limitations nd more features of typescript in 2016 angular developers came up with new version of angular which was angular 2+, which was complete revamp of angular, and this time they used typescript.


### But Browsers can only understand Javascript how angular application which is in typescipt run on browsers ?

Typescript is a language by microsoft. it is a superset of javascript, means it is built on javascript using its all features and adding its own features.

Typescript is compiled into javascript. thats how angular application works.
   
    Typescript code -----ts compiler ----> javascript code

### Typescript Language and how it is different from javascript ?

- Features

        1. Static Typing: Statically typed, meaning types are checked during compilation, catching errors early
        2. Type Inference: Can infer types from variable assignments and function parameters.
        3. Interfaces:Supports classes and inheritance with improved syntax.
        4. Decorators:Allows attaching metadata to declarations for code generation, configuration, and other purposes.
        5. Private and protected members:Supports access modifiers like private and protected for greater control over object member visibility.
        6.  Advanced object-oriented features:
        7. Build tooling integration:Compiles TypeScript code to JavaScript, supporting various build tools and configuration options.

### What is Single page application 

Before coming to Single page application consider we have to build a ecommerce website which sells apparels of `mens`, `womens`, `kids`.

#### - SPA : A single-page application (SPA) is a web app that loads a single HTML page and then updates the content dynamically without reloading the entire page. This is different from traditional web applications, which load a new page every time the user clicks a link or submits a form.

### How to install Angular ?

Here's how to install Angular on different operating systems:

**1. Install Node.js:**

Angular requires Node.js to run. You can download and install the latest version from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

**2. Install Angular CLI:**

Once Node.js is installed, open a terminal and run the following command to install the Angular CLI globally:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

This will install the Angular CLI globally on your system. You can use the `ng` command to access Angular CLI commands.

**3. Create a new Angular project:**

Run the following command to create a new Angular project named `my-app`:

```
ng new my-app
```

This will create a new directory called `my-app` with the basic structure for an Angular application.

**4. Start the development server:**

Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to start the development server:

```
cd my-app
ng serve
```

This will start a development server on port 4200. You can access the application in your web browser by navigating to [https://locall.host/4200/](https://locall.host/4200/).


### How do i check node js , npm and angular are installed properly ?

#### to check node js installed properly check node version using

- node -v 

#### to check version of npm check 
- npm -v 

#### to check version of angular use 
- ng version


### why do we need node js and what is npm ?

node js is a javascript runtime. 

    now what is javascript runtime 
    - as we all know only browsers had the power to run the javascript because browsers only had the javascript engines. 

    and javascript was only limited to frontend applications.

    but as the software system evolved many companies started building and developing a new and better javascript engine, their own engine which could run javascript. 


Node js is also one of them. it can run our javascript.

## But ??? Angular is not in js it is typescript based so why do we need node js here?

- Benefits of NODE js

    1. node js comes up with node package manager (NPM).NPM allows you to install and manage the various dependencies required by your Angular project.
    2. we need angular cli for angular related stuff, it needs node js to run. 
    3. Node allows you to spin up a lightweight web server to host your application locally in your system.


### what is angular cli ?

In the download process,we download three things 
1. node js 
2. npm 
3. angular-cli

`we didnt downloaded angular, we downloaded angular-cli ??`

### how to create angular application ?

*To create angular application we need to use command ng generate <project-name>*

**ng generate new-app**

The `ng new` command in the Angular CLI serves a crucial role in initializing and setting up new Angular projects. It performs several key tasks to get you started with development:

**1. Creates a New Project Directory:**

The command creates a new directory for your project with a standard structure recommended by the Angular team. This structure includes folders for components, services, directives, assets, and other essential elements.

**2. Generates Initial Project Files:**

It generates the essential files like `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `angular.json`, and others that define your project configuration, dependencies, and build settings.

**3. Installs Dependencies:**

The command automatically installs all necessary dependencies for your project, including the Angular framework itself, libraries, and other tools required for development.

**4. Sets Up Routing:**

It configures basic routing for your application, allowing you to define navigation between different views and components.


### explain the file structure of angular generated ?

when we created our projet with ng new we saw , cli generated the basic folder structure for our project with few files.

 **angular.json** : we know angular-cli is used to generate and do other stuff for angular, like `creating a new project` , `creating a local server`, `build our angular application`. 

so how does angular knows that on which command , what it has to do, these all configuration related to workspace is maintained in angular.json file.

- It stores information about the project's architecture, dependencies, build and test configurations, and other settings.
- This file allows you to control the build and runtime settings for your Angular application, as well as manage the different environments and configuration profiles for your project.

**package.json** 

In an Angular application, the `package.json` file plays a crucial role in managing the project's dependencies and build configurations. It acts as a central hub for storing information about the application, including:

**1. Project metadata:**
    * Name of the project
    * Version number
    * Description
    * Author information
    * License information

**2. Dependencies:**
    * Lists all the external libraries and modules your application uses
    * Specifies their versions and compatibility requirements
    * Distinguishes between dependencies needed for development (`devDependencies`) and those needed for production (`dependencies`)

**3. Scripts:**
    * Defines custom commands for automating tasks like building, testing, serving, and deploying the application

**4. Build configurations:**
    * Specifies how the application should be built for different environments (development, production, etc.)
    * Includes settings for optimization, minification, source maps, and other build options

**5. Other configurations:**
    * May contain additional settings specific to your project, such as linting rules, code formatting rules, and environment variables

**Importance of `package.json`:**

* **Dependency management:** Allows easy installation, update, and management of dependencies through tools like `npm` and `yarn`.
* **Build automation:** Enables efficient build processes through defined scripts and configurations.
* **Project information:** Provides a single location for centralizing project metadata and essential information.

**Overall, the `package.json` file serves as the backbone of your Angular application's development ecosystem. Understanding its structure and contents is crucial for managing dependencies, automating tasks, and ensuring efficient and consistent builds.**

**Package-lock.json**

`package-lock.json` is a file automatically generated by npm (Node Package Manager) when you install packages in your project. It serves as a lockfile that records the exact versions of all your dependencies and their sub-dependencies, creating a deterministic build environment.

Here's what it does:

**1. Locks package versions:**

* `package-lock.json` ensures that everyone working on the project installs the same versions of dependencies, regardless of their local environment or internet connection. This prevents unexpected behavior and inconsistencies during development and deployment.

**2. Reproducible builds:**

* By locking versions, `package-lock.json` guarantees that your project can be built with the same dependencies every time, regardless of when or by whom it is built. This is crucial for maintaining consistency and reproducibility across different environments.

**3. Reduced network traffic:**

* Since the exact versions are recorded, subsequent package installations only need to download new versions if necessary. This can significantly reduce network traffic and save time, especially for projects with large dependencies.

**4. Conflict resolution:**

* If conflicting versions of a dependency are found, `package-lock.json` helps resolve the conflict by choosing the closest compatible version. This prevents build errors and ensures that your project runs smoothly.

**5. Avoids dependency drift:**

* `package-lock.json` helps prevent unintentional changes in dependencies due to minor version bumps or updates in the npm registry. This ensures that your project remains stable and avoids unexpected regressions.

**Overall, `package-lock.json` plays a vital role in maintaining a stable, predictable, and reproducible development environment for your project.** It ensures consistent builds, prevents dependency conflicts, and reduces network traffic, making it an essential part of modern JavaScript development.

**tsConfig.json**

In an Angular application, `tsconfig.json` is a crucial configuration file that defines how the TypeScript compiler should process your code. It plays a vital role in various aspects of the development process, including:

**1. Compilation:**

* Specifies the compiler options for your TypeScript code, including the target JavaScript version, module resolution strategy, type checking, and other settings.
* Defines how the compiler generates the JavaScript files that your application runs on.

**2. Building:**

* Integrates with the Angular CLI to build your application for different environments like development and production.
* Allows configuration of the build process, including optimizations, minification, and asset handling.

**3. Linting:**

* Can be used with tools like TSLint or ESLint to enforce coding style and best practices.
* Helps maintain code quality and consistency throughout your project.

**4. Debugging:**

* Enables the generation of source maps, which map the compiled JavaScript code back to your original TypeScript code.
* Facilitates easier debugging by allowing you to inspect the original code when encountering errors.

**5. IDE Support:**

* Provides information to IDEs like Visual Studio Code or WebStorm to support features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and navigation.
* Enhances the development experience by making it easier to write and understand your code.

**Structure of tsconfig.json:**

The `tsconfig.json` file typically follows a specific structure with different sections:

* **compilerOptions:** Defines the core compiler settings for your TypeScript code.
* **include:** Specifies the files that the compiler should include in the build process.
* **exclude:** Specifies the files that the compiler should exclude from the build process.
* **files:** explicitly lists the files to be included in the compilation process.
* **references:** references other tsconfig files for more complex projects.
* **extends:** allows inheriting configurations from another tsconfig file.

**Importance of tsconfig.json:**

A well-configured `tsconfig.json` file is essential for ensuring a smooth and efficient development process. It allows you to control how the compiler processes your code, optimize the build process, and improve the overall quality and maintainability of your project.

**Overall, understanding and adjusting these options in `tsconfig.json` can greatly improve the development experience and ensure the quality and performance of your Angular application.**


**tsconfig-app.json**

In an Angular application, `tsconfig-app.json` is a configuration file that serves as an extension to the main `tsconfig.json` file. It allows you to define specific TypeScript compiler options for your application code, offering more granular control and flexibility.

Here's a breakdown of its role and benefits:

**Purpose:**

* **Extend and override options:** While `tsconfig.json` sets the general compiler options, `tsconfig-app.json` allows you to further tailor them specifically for the application code.
* **Modular configuration:** This separation keeps the core configuration separate from application-specific settings, improving maintainability and clarity.
* **Targeting specific code:** You can define compiler options that only apply to the application code, avoiding unnecessary processing for other parts of the project.

* **include/exclude:** Define which files to include or exclude from compilation for the application.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "extends": "./tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "sourceMap": true, // Enable source maps for debugging
    "declaration": false, // Don't generate type declaration files for production
    "outDir": "./out-tsc/app" // Set output directory for compiled files
  },
  "include": [
    "src/**/*.ts" // Include all TypeScript files in the src directory
  ]
}
```

**Overall, `tsconfig-app.json` is a powerful tool for customizing the TypeScript compiler settings for your Angular application. It allows you to achieve finer-grained control over the build process and ensure a tailored development experience.**

**node_modules**

In Node.js, **node modules** are directories containing reusable code packages. They are analogous to libraries or modules in other programming languages and play a crucial role in building and managing dependencies in your application.

**Here's a breakdown of what they are and their significance:**

**What are node modules?**

* Each node module is a directory containing various files, including the actual JavaScript code, package metadata (e.g., name, version, dependencies), and other relevant resources.
* They are typically installed using tools like `npm` or `yarn`, which download and manage the packages for your project.
* Node modules can be:
    * **Built-in:** Included with Node.js core and accessible without installation (e.g., `fs`, `http`).
    * **Third-party:** Created and published by developers and available through online repositories like npmJS.

**Benefits of using node modules:**

* **Code reuse:** Avoid reinventing the wheel by utilizing existing functionality from established modules.
* **Faster development:** Focus on your core logic while leveraging readily available functionalities.
* **Maintainability:** Keep your code organized and modular by separating functionalities into distinct modules.
* **Community contributions:** Benefit from a vast ecosystem of open-source modules and collaborate with other developers.
* **Dependency management:** Tools like `npm` and `yarn` simplify managing dependencies, ensuring compatibility and avoiding conflicts.

**Structure of a node module:**

* **`package.json`:** Contains metadata about the module, including name, version, dependencies, scripts, and other configurations.
* **JavaScript files:** The actual code implementing the module's functionalities.
* **Other files:** May include documentation, tests, assets, or other relevant resources.

**Using node modules in your project:**

* You can install modules using `npm install <module-name>`, which downloads the module and adds it to your project's `node_modules` directory.
* You can then import the module's functionalities into your code using the `require` function.

**Overall, node modules are essential building blocks for modern Node.js development. They enable code reuse, promote modularity, and foster a collaborative ecosystem for building robust and maintainable applications.**


### what is difference between build and serve ?

The terms "build" and "serve" refer to two different stages in the development lifecycle of an application. Here's a breakdown of their differences:

**Build:**

* **Process:** Building involves compiling your source code and resources (e.g., images, fonts) into a format that can be executed by the intended platform.
* **Output:** The build process generates the final, deployable version of your application. This typically includes bundled JavaScript files, optimized images, and other resources needed to run the application.
* **Purpose:** Building is necessary to prepare your application for deployment to a production environment or for distribution to users.
* **Frequency:** You usually build your application only when you make changes to your code and need to update the deployed version.

**Serve:**

The ng serve command is intentionally for fast, local and iterative developments and also for builds, watches and serves the application from a local CLI development server.

* **Process:** Serving refers to the act of running your application on a web server and making it accessible to users through a web browser.
* **Output:** Serving doesn't generate any new files. It simply allows users to access and interact with the already-built application.
* **Purpose:** Serving is used for testing and development purposes. It allows you to see how your application looks and behaves in a real environment without needing to deploy it.
* **Frequency:** You can serve your application multiple times during development to test different changes and features.

**Here's a table summarizing the key differences:**

| Feature | Build | Serve |
|---|---|---|
| Process | Compiles and bundles code | Runs the built application |
| Output | Deployable files | None |
| Purpose | Prepares for deployment | Testing and development |
| Frequency | Less frequent (after code changes) | More frequent (during development) |

In simpler terms, build is like preparing a meal to be stored and transported, while serve is like cooking and serving the meal to be eaten.


### what is the difference between `dependencies` and `dev-dependencies` ?

In an Angular application's `package.json` file, the key differences between `dependencies` and `devDependencies` lie in their purpose and usage:

**Dependencies:**

* **Purpose:** These are libraries and modules essential for the application's **runtime functionality**. They are necessary for the application to run correctly in both development and production environments.
* **Examples:** Angular core libraries, UI libraries like Bootstrap or Material Design, utility libraries like Lodash or Moment.js.
* **Installation:** Installed using the `npm install` or `yarn add` command.
* **Bundled:** Included in the final production build of the application.

**DevDependencies:**

* **Purpose:** These are libraries and modules used **only during development**. They are helpful for tasks like building, testing, linting, and formatting code, but are not required for the application to run.
* **Examples:** Webpack, Babel, TypeScript compiler, Karma test runner, Prettier code formatter.
* **Installation:** Installed using the `npm install -D` or `yarn add -D` command.
* **Not bundled:** Excluded from the final production build of the application.

**Key benefits of separating dependencies and dev dependencies:**

* **Clean production builds:** Only the essential libraries required for runtime are included, resulting in a smaller and faster application.
* **Improved development workflow:** Dev dependencies provide tools and libraries specifically for development tasks, enhancing efficiency and productivity.
* **Clear project structure:** Separating dependencies makes it easier to understand what your application needs to run versus what is used only during development.

**Additional considerations:**

* Some libraries have both runtime and development functionality. In such cases, they can be listed as both `dependencies` and `devDependencies` depending on their specific usage within your project.
* It's important to keep your dev dependencies up-to-date to ensure you have the latest tools and features for efficient development.

By understanding the distinction between dependencies and dev dependencies and managing them effectively, you can create clean, efficient, and well-maintained Angular applications.


### Deep dive into Angular Src Folder or main working folder ?

src folder is the main folder which contains code related to angular application. The files `package.json`, `angular.json`,`tsconfig.json` are the the files required for workspace configuration.

src folder contains:

        app |
             app-routing.module.ts
             app.component.css 
             app.component.html 
             app.component.spec.ts 
             app.component.ts 
             app.module.ts 
        
        assets 
        favicon.icon 
        index.html 
        main.ts 
        styles.css 



#### Note : index.html will load first in the browser. When index.html is loaded, the Angular core libraries, third-party libraries are loaded. Now the Angular will locate the entry point. The entry point of Angular application is main.ts. Which located under "src/main.ts".

**index.html**

In an Angular application, the index.html file plays a crucial role as the entry point for the application. It acts as the initial HTML document that your web browser loads and serves as a container for your application's content.



**main.ts**

The `main.ts` file is a crucial component of any Angular application. It serves as the **entry point** for your application and plays a key role in bootstrapping the application and initializing its functionalities.

Here’s a breakdown of the main functions and importance of `main.ts`:

**Primary functions:**

* **Imports essential modules:** This includes the Angular core libraries, your application's main module (e.g., `app.module.ts`), and any other necessary libraries or dependencies.
* **Bootstraps the application:** It uses the `platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule` function to launch the application and initiate its core functionality.
* **Provides initial configuration:** It might contain initial configuration options like platform providers or application settings.
* **Application entry point:** It acts as the starting point for executing your application code and rendering the user interface.

**Importance of `main.ts`:**

* **Essential for application startup:** Without `main.ts`, your Angular application cannot launch and display the user interface.
* **Bootstrapping process:** It orchestrates the initialization of the application, including modules, components, and services.
* **Centralized configuration:** It provides a single point for configuring the application environment and initial settings.

**Typical content of `main.ts`:**

* **Imports:** You’ll find imports for the Angular libraries, your main application module, and any additional modules or dependencies needed.
* **Platform bootstrapping:** The code will typically include a call to the `platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule` function, specifying the main application module as an argument.
* **Optional configuration:** You might find configuration options for the platform providers or application settings.

**Here’s a simplified example structure of `main.ts`:**

```typescript
import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';
import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';

platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

**Understanding the role of `main.ts` is crucial for building successful Angular applications. It acts as the foundation for launching and initializing your application, ensuring its smooth functioning and user interface rendering.**

**assets**

In an Angular application, the `assets` folder within the `src` directory serves as the container for all static assets used by your application. These assets include but are not limited to:

* **Images:** Logos, icons, illustrations, background images, etc.
* **Fonts:** Custom fonts used in your application.
* **Data files:** JSON files, CSV files, configuration files, etc.
* **Media files:** Audio files, video files, etc.
* **Other static content:** Any other file that doesn't require compilation or processing.

**Here's what makes the `assets` folder crucial:**

* **Centralized location:** Provides a dedicated space for all your static assets, making them easy to manage and access.
* **Accessibility:** All files within the `assets` folder are publicly accessible during development and production builds.
* **Build process integration:** Angular's build process automatically copies the contents of the `assets` folder to the output directory (usually `dist/`), ensuring they are included in the final application package.
* **Separation of concerns:** Keeps your code and static assets separate, improving code organization and maintainability.

**styles.css**

In Angular applications, the main difference between `styles.css` in the `src` directory and CSS files associated with individual components lies in their **scope and purpose**:

**1. `styles.css` in `src`:**

* **Global styles:** This file typically contains styles applied to the entire application, regardless of the component being rendered.
* **Base styles:** It often defines basic styles for common elements like fonts, colors, layout, and borders, establishing a consistent visual identity across the application.
* **Shared styles:** You can also include styles that are shared by multiple components to avoid code duplication and maintain consistency.

**2. CSS files with individual components:**

* **Component-specific styles:** These files contain styles tailored to the specific visual appearance and behavior of a single component.
* **Encapsulation:** Component styles encapsulate the styles within the component's scope, preventing them from affecting other components and ensuring cleaner and more predictable styling.
* **Modularization:** Having separate CSS files for each component promotes modularity and separation of concerns, making your code easier to maintain and organize.

**Here's a table summarizing the key differences:**

| Feature | `styles.css` in `src` | Component CSS Files |
|---|---|---|
| **Scope** | Global | Component-specific |
| **Purpose** | Define global styles | Define styles for specific components |
| **Encapsulation** | No | Yes |
| **Modularity** | Limited | High |
| **Code duplication** | More likely | Less likely |
| **Maintainability** | Can be challenging | Easier to maintain |

**Choosing the right approach depends on the specific context:**

* Use `styles.css` for global styles and shared styles used across the application.
* Use component-specific CSS files for styles that are unique to a single component.
* Utilize a combination of both approaches to achieve the desired balance between global consistency and component-specific customization.

**Here are some additional tips for managing CSS in Angular applications:**

* Consider using CSS preprocessors like Sass or Less for enhanced features and cleaner syntax.
* Use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS to speed up development and ensure consistent design patterns.
* Implement linting tools to enforce coding standards and maintain code quality.
* Leverage component isolation tools like Shadow DOM to further enhance style encapsulation.

By understanding the differences and best practices for managing CSS files in Angular, you can achieve a clean, maintainable, and visually appealing application.


### what is the role of platformBrowserDynamic ?

In Angular applications, `platformBrowserDynamic` plays a crucial role in bootstrapping the application and launching it in the browser environment. It essentially acts as **the bridge between your Angular application code and the browser platform**.

Here's a breakdown of its functions and significance:

**Functions of `platformBrowserDynamic`:**

* **Creates a platform:** It creates a platform instance specifically designed for running Angular applications in the browser environment.
* **Loads modules:** It dynamically loads the necessary Angular modules, including the core libraries and your application's main module.
* **Bootstraps the application:** It initializes the application by instantiating the root component and rendering it to the DOM (Document Object Model) of the browser.
* **Provides services:** It provides platform-specific services like zone.js and reflection, which are essential for Angular's functionality.

**Significance of `platformBrowserDynamic`:**

* **Application startup:** `platformBrowserDynamic` is the starting point for your Angular application in the browser.
* **Module loading:** It ensures that all necessary modules are loaded before your application starts running.
* **Component rendering:** It facilitates the rendering of your application's components to the browser window.
* **Platform services:** It provides essential platform-specific services for smooth application execution.

**Typical usage of `platformBrowserDynamic`:**

```typescript
import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';
import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';

platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

This code snippet imports the `platformBrowserDynamic` function and your application's main module (AppModule). It then bootstraps the application by calling the `bootstrapModule` method, specifying the AppModule as an argument.

**Additionally, `platformBrowserDynamic` offers various configuration options:**

* **Extra providers:** You can provide additional providers during bootstrapping for services needed throughout the application.
* **Error handling:** You can specify a callback function to handle errors that occur during application initialization.

**Overall, `platformBrowserDynamic` is a fundamental component in the Angular framework. It plays a vital role in launching your application and ensuring its smooth operation in the browser environment.**
